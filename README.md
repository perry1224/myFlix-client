# myFlix-client

This the client-side of movie application. The app will allow users to register, display a list of all movies in the database, create a list of favourites within which they can add and remove movies, get information about different directors and movie genres, they will also be able to deregister from the app.

## How to Use This App

When first opening the app, register your own personal account, then log in to view the database and make your own list of favorites!

## Reflections on this project:
My role for this project is to create a fully functional frontend client server using primarily React. Although using react for a big project was quite enjoyable, it was also quite challenging. From creating different jsx files and linking them from learning how to apply useState and Props was a lot of information to take in. I had to step back from the project and search for more simpler projects with React to get a better understanding on what it is for and how it is used. One of the valuable lessons from this is learning the importance of using class components and functional components. Functional components creates cleaner code and ideally I would like to use it but in reality class components exists in many projects so it cannot be ignored. If I can redo this project I would take extra tutorial lessons elsewhere on React and Redux before diving into myFlix-client side.
